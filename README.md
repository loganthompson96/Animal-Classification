# Image Classification
A python program that uses machine learning and the images of 10 different animals to train a model to classify them correctly. This model uses 3 convolutional layers along with a ReLU layer.

This program was built by Logan Thompson as part of the University of California, Santa Cruz CSE 144: Applied Machine Learning course taught by Professor Cihang Xie.
